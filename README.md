Experimenting with evolution modelling and simulation.

## Inspiration

The origin of my fascination with biological simulators began with the [Primer](https://www.youtube.com/c/PrimerLearning) YouTube channel. Here, some fascinating biological topics are modelled including competition, natural selection and social behaviours of organisms, all accompanied by some quite lovely animations.

Since I watched the Primer series of videos the YouTube algorithm has blessed me with a variety of simulator projects, my favourite of which being [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk) by David R. Miller (his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/davidrandallmiller) and [GitHub](https://github.com/davidrmiller)).

I especially like the way in which he simulated genes and how "intelligent" behaviours can develop through simple random processes.

The next inspiration and the one that finally propelled me to start this project was [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4sLAQvEH-M) excellent video from Derek Muller of [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA).

The video got me to think about whether a computer simulated E. coli-like bacterium could achieve similar behaviours to the experiment, notably [***Spoiler Warning!***] evolving to consume an additional food source and a relative fitness that conformed to the power law model.
